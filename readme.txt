Automatically issue Verifactu invoices for your WooCommerce orders.

== Description ==

Are you tired of dealing with the complexity of invoicing and the new Verifactu regulations in your WooCommerce store? With **Verifactu Pro**, tax management and Verifactu invoice issuance become so simple you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

Forget about penalties and stress! Verifactu Pro is the ultimate solution for your online business to comply with all legal requirements in Spain and globally, completely automatically.

= Why You Should Use Verifactu Pro =
With the entry into force of Verifactu, invoices issued by WooCommerce are no longer valid in Spain. Invoicing has become a little more complicated. But don't worry, Verifactu Pro not only helps you comply, it makes it super easy!

* **Self-generating Verifactu Invoices**: Every sale in your WooCommerce store generates an invoice that has EVERYTHING for Verifactu: the QR code, the security "fingerprint"... You don't have to lift a finger!
* **Direct to the Tax Agency, no stops**: Quaderno takes care of sending your invoices to the Tax Agency (AEAT) automatically. This ensures you comply without a single extra click.
* **Save time and say goodbye to errors**: Tired of creating invoices manually? Free yourself from that boring task and say goodbye to mistakes. Verifactu Pro automates everything so you can dedicate yourself to what you really love: growing your business!
* **Always up-to-date with the law**: Tax regulations change more often than the weather in spring. Verifactu Pro is always on alert and adapts your invoicing so you always comply, wherever you sell.
* **Plays well with WooCommerce**: Our plugin integrates perfectly with your store. It calculates the taxes for each sale and manages invoices and refunds no matter where your customers are. It's a match made in heaven!
* **Easy-to-understand tax reports**: Do you need your reports for tax declarations? With a single click, you have them, clear and ready to submit. You'll have all the information you need in the blink of an eye!

= The Peace of Mind of Having a "Super Accountant" by Your Side =
Verifactu Pro is much more than a simple plugin. It's part of Quaderno, an invoicing and tax management platform that offers you:

* **Accurate tax calculation**: Forget about doing calculations. Quaderno calculates the exact VAT for each sale, adapting to where your customer is located. It's foolproof!
* **Support that understands you**: Do you have tax questions? Our support team is there to help you with whatever you need. You'll never feel alone!
* **Everything under control in one place**: If you sell on multiple platforms (WooCommerce, Shopify, Amazon FBA...), Quaderno gathers all your tax info in one place. That's how easy it is to manage your accounting!

**Don't let bureaucracy get the better of you. With Verifactu Pro and WooCommerce, complying with Verifactu is a breeze.** üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are Verifactu invoices generated? =
It's very simple! Every time you mark an order as complete, Quaderno will issue a Verifactu invoice and send it to the Tax Agency and your customer.

= Does it work with TicketBAI? =
Absolutely! If you're a seller residing in the Basque Country, Quaderno will issue your invoices in **TicketBAI** format and send them to your Foral Tax Authority.

= Do I have to ask my customers for all their billing details? =
We recommend you do. The more data you have, the easier it will be to justify the sale to the Tax Agency. And studies show it doesn't affect conversion rates.

Of course! If you sell on **Amazon FBA** or **Shopify**, you can connect those platforms to your Quaderno account. This way, you'll have all your sales and reports in one place.
